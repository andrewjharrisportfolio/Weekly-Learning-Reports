# SANS Weekly Learning Report: Week [2]  
**Dates:** [2-10] - [2-22]  

This week will be a short learning report I Just wrapped up a fast, multithreaded port scanner in Python! 
This project helped me dive deeper into socket programming, multithreading, and concurrency handling, making network scanning more efficient.

you can view the project here: https://github.com/andrewjharrisportfolio/Threaded-Port-Scanner-in-Python

Key Takeaways:
✅ Used Python sockets for network scanning
✅ Implemented multithreading for speed
✅ Handled IP addresses & port ranges dynamically
✅ Managed timeouts & exception handling for reliability
✅ Learned about queues to handle multiple threads

How It Works:
1️⃣ Establish a socket connection to test open ports
2️⃣ Scan standardized ports (initially slow)
3️⃣ Introduce multithreading to speed up scans
4️⃣ Use queues to manage port assignments across threads
5️⃣ Print open ports efficiently 🎯

Big thanks to freeCodeCamp.org for an amazing tutorial! 🎓
